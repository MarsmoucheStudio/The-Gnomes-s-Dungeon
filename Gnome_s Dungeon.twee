:: dg1 {"position":"500,700","size":"100,100"}
The door slowly opens, allowing you into a large, circular room. You scratch your
head quizzically. In the center of the room, you can see a small island
surrounded by a wide trench, on which stands a chest, locked with metal
fastenings. The trench is wide and very deep. At the other side of the room is a door, that should allow you to leave this dangerous area. 
Will you :

[[Try to jump to the center of the room, where is the chest|dg1 jump]]
[[Try to walk on the side of the room to reach the opposite door|dg1 walk]]
[[Try to go back to the place you were before.|dg1 garry bob]]



:: dg1 garry bob {"position":"800,700","size":"100,100"}
You open the door and go back to the room of the gnome wizard. He looks at you and says: Mmmmm... $name, I was thinking a $class could do better...

He points at you with his finger and throws a fireball at your head. You burn to your death, in the most painful way. . . 

[[Start again|1]]


:: dg1 jump {"position":"600,700","size":"100,100"}
You jump and fail. At the very moment you jumped, you broke your toe and fell in the trench. After a moment you realize that you are still alive, although badly hurt. You look around and see that the trench was an extremely convincing painting and that there was, in fact, no real ditch. You hit the chest with a rock you find on the ground and break its lock. Inside  is a small key. You walk to the door and try to open it with the key and it works!
Itâ€™s your lucky day ; - )

[[Open the door|dg2]]


:: dg1 walk {"position":"700,700","size":"100,100"}
You try to walk and everything works fine until you reach the door. You try to open it but it is locked, so you try to slam it with a rock you see on the ground. But as you try to grab the rock, your head hits the door. You fall to the ground, Dead. 

[[Start again|1]]


:: dg2 {"position":"500,900","size":"100,100"}
You open the door and see what seems to be a luxurious bedroom. This room is really gorgeous, and contains a big bed, some paintings, a small table and an  acacia chair. At your right there is a door.

On the chair there is a Beautiful lady. She take a look at you and ask you
to come give her a foot massage.

[[Run to the door|dg2 run]]
[[Give her a foot massage|dg2 feets]]


:: dg2 feets {"position":"600,900","size":"100,100"}
You say hi, and start to talk with her while giving her a foot massage. She tells you that she is the daughter of the great gnome wizard and she is happy to have a visitor. After talking a bit with you she gives you a key. You say goodbye, and use the key to open the door at your right. 

[[Open the door|dg3]]


:: dg2 run {"position":"700,900","size":"100,100"}
You know it's a trap, it can't be real, so you run to the door. But you trip, fall on the ground and open your head, blood spilling everywhere. The beautiful young lady just has the time to say : What the f...
before you die.

[[Start again|1]]


:: dg3 {"position":"500,1100","size":"100,100"}
You open the door and immediately fall to the ground. You just hear some little irking voices saying : Mmmm... Maybe we should eat him... 
No, no time for hesitations... We WILL eat him...
You don't have the time to hear more, You fall unconscious.

:: dg3gnome {"position":"100,1100","size":"100,100"}
<b>-Gnome2.</b> Mmmmm... An Elf.... It will taste good....
<b>-Gnome1.</b> Shut up.... He may know the way out!

You wake up and see that you are in a small dark room. Just in front of you
are what seems to be gnomes. These gnomes were watching you and seem to start 
to walk towards you.
You try to run towards them and hit one with a rock, but you realize that you 
have been attached.
One of the gnome stops his walk, stands right in front of you and say :
We only need to know one thing... Are you gonna be stupid and try to bullshit us ?

:: dg4 {"position":"500,1300","size":"100,100"}
You open the door and find what appears to be a pleasant little living room. On the ground is a large green carpet on which is placed a small table of shiny wood. On the table is a deck of cards.

[[Take the cards|dg4 cards]]

:: dg5 {"position":"500,1500","size":"100,100"}
When you open the door you realize that the walls of the room you are in now are all covered in blood. In the center of the room is an old man dressed in noble clothes, on his head rests a crown and on his shoulders a golden cape. The man holds out his hand to you and mutters: ...Help...help!

[[help him|dg5 help]]

:: dg5 help {"position":"600,1500","size":"100,100"}
You nervously approach the man and ask him if he's okay. The man looks at you and jumps on you. no matter how hard you hit him with your sword, he resists your cuts, his skin is very hard. After a short struggle he breaks your neck. You are dead.

[[Start again|1]]


:: dg6 {"position":"500,1700","size":"100,100"}
You open the door and enter what appears to be a large dining room. However this room is very old therefore the long wooden table is rotten and the walls are covered with mold.

Sitting at the table is four old gnome who do nothing but sigh.
Seeing you, the oldest and tallest gnome jumps out of his chair and runs towards you. He stops in front of you and stares at you with wide empty eyes before saying:
I'm looking for my deck of cards... haven't you seen it somewhere?

[[Says : Yup for sure, I have it|dg6 no cards]]

You open the door and enter what appears to be a long hallway. The hallway splits in half about halfway through, but both sides of the hallway go in roughly the same direction until they reach a door.

:: dg8right {"position":"400,2100","size":"100,100"}
You open the door and enter a large room, probably the largest you have ever explored. The room is divided in two by large iron bars too close for you to pass. In both sides of the room there is nothing but a large lever behind a goblin. Each of the two goblins wears black clothes and a hat in the shape of a triangle. 

When he see you the goblin take a dagger and run toward you
You have to fight.

:: rock {"position":"0,1700","size":"100,100"}
The gnome doesn't even have enough time to say another word, as the rock knocks him out, and he falls to the ground. You run and stab him with his own knife, as fast as you can, feeling the delicious taste of revenge.
You take a minute to catch your breath and open the door.
The door leads to a stair, which seems to go deeper in the dungeon.

[[Go deeper|dg4]]


:: run {"position":"100,1700","size":"100,100"}
You haven't even took a step, that you feel the cold touch of the knife. The gnome sliced leg, at your shin, which makes you fall to your knees. Now at a reasonable height for his finishing move, he plunges his sharp knife straight into your nose, thus damaging your brain. The tears covering your face mixes with the brain liquids that drip from the gaping hole in the center of your face. You die.

<b>-Gnome1.</b> He's a retard... lets kill him, he doesn't know shit.

After saying this the gnome takes a knife and slices your Achilles tendon. As 
you lose your stability, the three gnomes jump on your body, and climb to your 
face and hands like small savage monkeys. With the use of their knives and their 
sharp teeth, they rip your fingers away, and bite your face until you are 
unrecognizable. They pierce your body from part to part, and rip your limbs off. You're dead. . .

[[Start again|1]]


:: sword {"position":"200,1700","size":"100,100"}
You don't even have time to grab your sword, that you feel the cold touch of the knife. The gnome stabs you in the hand, and you take that opportunity to strike him in the face with your free fist. Unfortunately, he dodges the attack with ease, and slashes your carotid with his blade. You try to cover the wound, and stop the blood flow, but it's too late. Losing all your blood, as the gnome stabs you until your last breath, you die.
